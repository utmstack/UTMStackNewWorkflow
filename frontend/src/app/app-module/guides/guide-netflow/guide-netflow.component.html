      NetFlow is a feature that was introduced on Cisco routers around 1996 that provides the ability to collect IP
      network traffic as it enters or exits an interface. By analyzing the data provided by NetFlow, a network
      administrator can determine things such as the source and destination of traffic, class of service, and the causes
      of congestion. A typical flow monitoring setup (using NetFlow) consists of three main components.
