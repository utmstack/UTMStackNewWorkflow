      AWS Lambda automatically monitors Lambda functions on your behalf, reporting metrics through Amazon CloudWatch. To
      help you troubleshoot failures in a function, Lambda logs all requests handled by your function and also
      automatically stores logs generated by your code through Amazon CloudWatch Logs.<br><br>
      You can insert logging statements into your code to help you validate that your code is working as expected.
      Lambda automatically integrates with CloudWatch Logs and pushes all logs from your code to a CloudWatch Logs group
      associated with a Lambda function, which is named /aws/lambda/&lt;function name&gt;.<br><br>
      We need to receive the CloudWatch Logs groups names to configure our collector.
