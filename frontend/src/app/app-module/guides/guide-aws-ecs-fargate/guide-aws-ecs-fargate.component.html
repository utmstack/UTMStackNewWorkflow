      For this integration to work properly, first you need to configure the IAM user for UTMStack.
    </div>

    <h6 class="font-weight-semibold mt-3 mb-3">
      A task definition is required to run Docker containers in Amazon ECS. Some of the parameters you can specify in a
      task definition include:
    </h6>
    <ul class="mt-3 pl-3 list-circle">
      <li>The Docker image to use with each container in your task</li>
      <li>How much CPU and memory to use with each task</li>
      <li>
        The launch type to use, which determines the infrastructure on which your tasks are hosted
      </li>
      <li>The Docker networking mode to use for the containers in your task</li>
      <li>Whether the task should continue to run if the container finishes or fails</li>
      <li>The command the container should run when it is started</li>
      <li>Any data volumes that should be used with the containers in the task</li>
      <li>The IAM role that your tasks should use</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-3">
      You can configure the containers in your tasks to send log information to CloudWatch Logs. If you are using the
      Fargate launch type for your tasks, all you need to do to enable the awslogs log driver is mark the option
      “Auto-configure CloudWatch Logs” on the containers configuration and send to us the log group name.
    </p>
    <div class="alert alert-info alert-styled-right mt-3">
      The type of information that is logged by the containers in your task depends mostly on their ENTRYPOINT command.
      By default, the logs that are captured show the command output that you would normally see in an interactive
      terminal if you ran the container locally, which are the STDOUT and STDERR I/O streams. The awslogs log driver
      simply passes these logs from Docker to CloudWatch Logs.
